             <p> Born in Lagos, Nigeria. Adeola is a good dancer who loves to show his dancing skills at any opportunity he gets.
                Adeola is the second of four siblings. Graduated from University of Lagos with a Bachelor's degree in history.</p>
                <p> Soccer is my first love. then i fell in love with Basketball few years ago when i moved to the United states.
                  I also find other sports interesting, i love baseball, Formula one, boking, MMA, Golf, Tennis, and NFL.</p>
                  <p> I have always been facinated with the internet. imagining the way websites and games were created and how it can be improved 
                    in every aspect. That was the reason why i chose to go to a coding bootcamp and learn all this and become a Software developer. </p>
                    <p> One other motibvation i have is to make my community back in Nigeria a better place it used to be when i was growing up.
                      I had the toughest of times because of the poverty rate and i want to try as much as possible for the kids behind 
                      me to have a better upbringing than i had.</p>
